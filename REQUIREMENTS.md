# Nexus\Payment Requirements Specification

**Package:** `azaharizaman/nexus-payment`  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** 🟢 Implemented (100% Complete)  
**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025  
**Author:** Nexus Architecture Team

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The `Nexus\Payment` package provides a framework-agnostic payment processing foundation for ERP systems. It defines core abstractions for payment transactions, payment methods, disbursements, and reconciliation that can be extended by specialized extension packages.

### 1.1 Purpose

- Provide unified payment transaction model across all payment methods
- Define core interfaces for payment execution and tracking
- Support both inbound (receipts) and outbound (disbursements) payments
- Enable multi-currency payment processing
- Provide reconciliation and settlement abstractions

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Payment transaction lifecycle management
- Payment method abstraction layer
- Disbursement/payout processing
- Settlement and reconciliation interfaces
- Payment status tracking and events
- Multi-currency support via `Nexus\Common\ValueObjects\Money`

**Out of Scope (Handled by Extensions):**
- Specific payment rails (ACH, Wire, Check) → `PaymentRails`
- Gateway integrations (Stripe, PayPal) → `PaymentGateway`
- Bank integrations (Plaid, Open Banking) → `PaymentBank`
- Digital wallets (Apple Pay, BNPL) → `PaymentWallet`
- Subscription/recurring billing → `PaymentRecurring`
